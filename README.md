# EvoLangDoubleBlind

The impact of introducing double blind reviewing in the most recent Evolution of Language conference is assessed.  The ranking of papers is compared between EvoLang 11 (double blind review) and EvoLang 9 and 10 (single blind review).  Main effects were found for first author gender by conference.  The results mirror some findings in the literature on the effects of double blind review, suggesting that it helps reduce a bias against female authors.
